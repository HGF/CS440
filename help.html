<h3><u>Welcome Screen</u></h3>
This screen is the basis of the system. It is this screen that allows you to almost all of the other aspects of the inventory system. The large central box will initially be blank, but will be updated as the system is used to reflect recent changes to the library. The buttons along the side are what you use to navigate around the system. When you click on one, it will bring you to a page with the required forms for you to perform the designated action.
<h3><u>Logging in</u></h3>
Some operations can only be performed by Administrators. Any such operation will require an administrator privileges. In order for the operation to proceed you must enter accurate information matching the account of an existing administrator and hit the “Enter” button.

<h3><u>Searching for Books</u></h3>
When you click the “Search” button you will be brought to this page. You have the option of searching for a book by ISBN, keywords, title, or author(s) by typing the information into the respective boxes for each and pressing the “Enter” button. ISBN searches are performed independently of the other three criteria and thus there is a separate “Enter” button to perform searches by ISBN.
<br><br>
After the search has been performed you will be brought to a web page with a list of books which meet the given criteria. To view the particular book you are interested in simply click the hyperlink to that book.
<h3><u>Browsing books</u></h3>
When you click the “Browse” button you will be brought to this page. This page is very similar to the page which results from performing a search, except that it shows a listing of every book in the library instead of just certain ones.
<br><br>
Once again to view a particular book simply click on the associated hyperlink and you will be brought to its page.
<h3><u>Viewing checked out books</u></h3>
When you click the “View Checked Out” button you will be brought to this page. This is very much like the “Browse” page except that instead of showing every book, it only shows books which are currently checked out. Furthermore this page displays the user who checked out the book in front of the book itself, and the listing is sorted by these usernames.
